					<p>The history to the name and the use of "via", came-out of the idea to operate Dubai as a eHUB between East and West, whereas the name naturally become "VIA DUBAI", you can here see the first graphical image of "VIA DUBAI".</p>
					<p>Already 1998 the founder held a speech in Dubai for the Chamber of Commerce where he presented the idea and proposed that Dubai should start its own electronic currency, and proposed the creation of the d-dollar (Dubai dollar). it was also proposed to use Dubai as an IT hub a connection center between east and west, and thereafter was Dubai Internet City created.</p>
					<p>When the shape of ViA as a Business Model Innovation started to take shape, we where advice to not use "Dubai" in our name, instead form a name explaining what we offer and what we do"</p>

				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-justify">
					<p><br></p>
					<p>This is the official registered ViA Logo.</p>
					<p>The ViA Logo came to be designed by the founder of the ViA Group; Lars Olof Kanngard as a result of giving a graphical description of what the company actually is doing.</p>
					<p>The basic concept around the ViA Model is based on making instant transactions more secure. One of the first security innovations was the STS-Secure Transaction String, which makes data transferred more secure. So the way it works as what ViA does and that's why the ViA logo came to be designed like this:</p>

			<div class="green"><h3><strong>What you see is what we do</strong></h3></div>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<img class="img-responsive"src="img/via_animation_step.png" alt="ViA Logotype">
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-justify">
					<p><br></p>
					<p>Actually, with just a little of explanations, you quickly will see that what we do is what you see also as an reflection in the designed ViA Logo. </p>
					<p>the first "V" is the only correct alphabetic character but it is actually an ARROW pointing in to ViA, which symbolizes that we bring data or transactions in to ViA. e, so that means we do bring information in to ViA, which is symbolized by the first letter, the "V" which in the image are an arrow in to the company.</p>
					<p>The second part of the ViA Logo is not an "i" it is actually a ONE and a ZERO built together into one character, explaining we processes Data and it symbolizes IT.</p>
					<p>The third character is an ARROW OUT completing the PROCESS where we did bring in transaction data, processed the data and sent the processed data back-out in a secure and in a better way!</p>

			<div class="green"><h3><strong>"VIA" as the name</strong></h3></div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-justify">
					<p><br></p>
					<p>The use of the word "VIA" goes back to the middle of 90th, when the founder and his team operated and created some of the first multi-line AUDIOTEX system solutions in the world, which became ESSELTE VOICE where also the legendary system, the MiniVoice system was one of several milestone-innovations, by its team. Everything was related that we did things 'via voice' 'via telephony' so at a later stage when the production of the MiniVoice system came under its own entity the name VIATEL was a natural choice, and that is where the word 'via' came to start in Sweden in the telecom sector.</p>
					<p>ViATEL was the first company within the family of 'Kanngard' which got the name 'via' shortly followed by VIP.</p>			
					<p><br></p>
				</div>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-12"> <!-- box 2 -->
			<div class="green"><h3><strong>"VIA" the word VIA</strong></h3></div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-justify">
					<p><br></p>
					<p>The word "VIA" means; "traveling through (a place) en route to a destination." or "by way of; through" and by Latin: "Way, Road.</p>			
					<p><br></p>
				</div>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-12"> <!-- box 3 -->
			<div class="green"><h3><strong>"best way" or "a better way"</strong></h3></div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-justify">
					<p><br></p>
					<p>When the name came to live as the corporate name, we also was trying to agree on a slogan. The different suggestions was:</p>			
					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class="list-group-item">ViA the best way !</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">ViA the road forward !</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">ViA a better way !</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-justify">
					<p>To say "the best way" than if someone comes with an improvements, which you may not see today, you would become the "second best way" which is not so good. To say "the road forward" is a good expression, but bring little or no association to make things different or have a new revolutionary concept in your hand. To say "a better way" is perfect and leaves all door open to make improvements and join forces with others, who can contribute to a "better way"</p>			
					<p><br></p>
				</div>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-12"> <!-- box 4 -->
			<div class="green"><h3><strong>"VIA" in one letter</strong></h3></div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-justify">
					<p><br></p>
					<p>As for all 'card-brand' ViA did need to have its own 'letter' a single character, which preferable, by just looking on it, would give the as so si at ion to the word it should or rather the brand it should represent. So that was how the ViA Single Character was created.</p>			
					<p>Here you can see the ViA Single Character in action</p>

				<div class="col-md-12">
					<img class="img-responsive" style="margin: 0 auto;clear:both;"src="img/ViA_Carton_Filmstrip_150.png" alt="ViA Logotype">
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-justify">
					<p><br></p>
					<p>As you can see, the ViA Single Letter,, truly looks like 'ViA' and we also have developed it into a font.</p>
